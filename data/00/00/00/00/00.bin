----[Release Notes]-------------------------------------:

The ultimate buddy-cop shooter!

Two cops, one case and only 24 hours to take them down...
can you score the bust of a lifetime? Take the role of a
loose cannon police detective and face off against 
criminal gangs in an exciting procedurally-generated 
action movie FPS. Join forces with a friend, online or 
locally, and take down those crooks in true buddy-cop 
style!

As a part of the RICO task force, your mission is clear: 
get in, take down the criminals and get out again. 
Sounds easy, but it's not - procedurally-generated cases
mean you'll never know who or what's waiting for you. 
Pick your load-out, then use the element of surprise to 
get a tactical edge over the enemy. Unlock new weapons, 
mission types and traits, or dive into Daily Play and see
how high you can climb the cop rankings!

- Take down criminal gangs with extreme prejudice and 
solve the RICO case - you've only got 24 hours, 
detective!

- Procedurally-generated cases mean no two games are ever
the same - you'll never know what's waiting for you.

- Crack cases with a friend, either online or locally, 
for co-op carnage. Two loose cannons are always better 
than one!

- Daily Play cases - with leaderboards and rewards - 
keep you coming back for more, along with unlockable 
weapons, traits and mission types to discover.
